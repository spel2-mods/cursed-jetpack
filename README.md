# [Cursed Jetpack](https://spelunky.fyi/mods/m/cursed-jetpack/)

Always starts in a cursed state with a jetpack. Even when resurrecting in the coffin, the health remains at 1, and a jetpack is equipped on the back. Even if the jetpack is discarded, it starts equipped in the next stage. Other power-ups (mitt, shoes, ...) or worn items (cape, hover pack, ...) disappear upon advancing to the next stage.
